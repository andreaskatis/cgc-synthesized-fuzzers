## Email_System_2 Fuzzer
https://github.com/trailofbits/cb-multios/tree/master/challenges/Email_System_2

## Application information
Email_System_2 creates a system to create user accounts and log in to those accounts to create, view, send, and delete drafts, as well as to list received messages. Each account can only hold 20 drafts at a time, and must either send or delete drafts in order to create more.

Upon creating a new draft, the application requests a username and then the message contents. If the user name is valid, the message is saved into drafts. Otherwise, the message is deleted.

Sending and deleting drafts both present an indexed list of the available drafts (beginning at 0). The user then gives a message ID corresponding to the list. If the ID is valid, then the application sends or deletes the chosen draft.

## Vulnerabilities
Email_System_2 has two vulnerabilities.
1. Normally, each user can't create more than four messages per login, and can only hold 20 messages at a time. However, the user can repeatedly log in, create messages, and log out until they have more than 21 messages. Because the messages are stored in a 2D array (with one axis storing users and the other storing messages), if the final user is signed in, the newest message will overflow the array. This overwrites the "printer" function pointer, causing a crash at the next print call (such as view drafts).
2. If a user creates exactly 20 messages, logs out, and then intentionally fails their login three times in a row, the application allows login with any password on the fourth attempt. If the user then creates another message, the message array overflows causing the same crash as in the first vulnerability.

## Fuzzer information
The fuzzer sends 206 ints, which the relay then converts into a useable message for the application. The use and expected ranges for the generated ints are as follows:

    Variable Name       Usage                                                       Expected Range      Instances
    main                Represent which main command to send                        [1, 3]              1
    length              Limits the length of the generated strings                  [1, 100]            2
    cha                 Represents chars using ASCII conversion                     [32, 126]           200
    index               Refers to an index in the user array                        [0, +âˆž)             2
    flag                Flags whether or not to give a valid password upon login    [0, 1]              1
    user                Represent which user command to send                        [1, 8]              1
    id                  Represents a specific message ID                            [0, 21]             1

Due to the range of possible usernames and passwords, the relay keeps an array of used usernames and their corresponding passwords to refer to when in the process of interacting with the application. Because of this, the relay uses a modulo function to limit the index values to userArr.length + 1.

The relay always starts by sending main as the initial command
    If main == 1: Send the generated username and password and update the corresponding arrays in the relay
    If main == 2:
	    If index1 > userArr.length: Send the generated username and password (invalid username login attempt)
	    Else if flag == 1: Send userArr[index1] and the generated password (valid username with invalid password)
        
        Else: Send userArr[index1] with the corresponding password (valid login attempt), then send the user command
	    	If user == 1:
	    		If index2 > userArr.length: Send the generated username and password (send message to invalid user) then logout
	    		Else: Send userArr[index1] and the generated password (send random message to valid user) then logout
	    	If user == 2 or 6: Send the message ID then logout
	    	If user == 3, 4, or 5: Logout
	    	If user == 7: Do nothing
	    	If user == 8: Clear the username and password arrays
    If main == 3: Clear the username and password arrays

## Running the fuzzer
The fuzzer files must be named email_system_2.c in order to build properly.
Run the make file found in the build folder.
Once the build process is complete, run fuzz.sh in the bin folder.
